# POINTSPIDER
Multimodal alignment of images and point clouds on the modelnet-c dataset

## Dataset
The data from this project was sourced from [Github](https://github.com/jiachens/ModelNet40-C/). All credits go to the respective authors.

## Report
The findings of the experiments can be found in the [report](./multimodal_representation_report.pdf). The LaTeX source can be found in [this directory](./multimodal_representation_report).

## Replication
The main notebook to be run with the configurations mentioned in the report can be found [here](./notebooks/multimodal-alignment/Multimodal_projection_training_testing.ipynb).

This work is a part of my 20-credit project done under the supervision of Prof. Jaya Sreevalsan Nair.
